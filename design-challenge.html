						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">We began by determining the design challenge, which is a worksheet from the Human Centered Design Toolkit that helps us form our final design question .</p>
					</header>
				<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
					<p>Letting people in hospice, who don’t have loved ones around anymore, know that they are loved through the gesture of giving flowers.</p>
					<h3>Frame it as a design question.</h3>
					<p>How might we reach more volunteers and donors through the website?</p>
					<h3>Now, state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have.</h3>
					<p>Give people in hospice flowers to show that they are loved and appreciated.</p>
					<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
					<p>Hierarchy, high quality images, organization, fix icons that don’t make sense, fix busy pages, and add more white space</p>
					<h3>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing.</h3>
					<p>Organization will not interview with me because they are too busy. May have trouble collecting all content I need because they are in Portland.</p>
					<h3>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
					<p>How might we organize the website to where volunteers and donors can easily be engaged with the bloom project?</p>
