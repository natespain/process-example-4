						<h1>Determine Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p> After the research portion of the project, I began to focus in on who my audience was and how to apply my audience to my goals for the website.</p>
					</header>
					  <h2>Audience</h2>
						<p>First, I began by determining a broad audience. I slowly began to narrow down my audience so that I could focus in on them specifically.</p>
					  </p>
						<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/stickynote1 copy.JPG" alt="stickynotes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>This was my first attempt at figuring out exactly who my audience was. I started out with the broad audience members and branched off of those. These audience members were ranging anywhere from florists, gardening club members, high schoolers, churches, newlyweds, companies or organizations that want to help sponsor The Bloom Project and people in hospice.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/stickynote2 copy.JPG" alt="stickynotes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>I realized that people in hospice would not really be my target audience, since they are the ones who would be recieving the gift, so I narrowed it down to volunteers and donors. I also took out one of the volunteers I previously had, "other people who need community service hours", because they didn't seem like a very important target group.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/stickynote3.jpg" alt="stickynotes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>I then narrowed my audience down to just volunteers and donors. Although this may seem broad, it is appropriate for my specific audience.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/stickynote4 copy.JPG" alt="stickynotes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>This shows who the skeptics would be, which is pretty much only those who are against hospice as a whole.</p></div>

				<h3>Goals Conclusions</h3>
				<p>Overall, the goal I have for The Bloom Project is to reach as many hospice patients as possible by easily engaging people to become volunteers and/or donors. The audiences’ goals are to gather information that shows who they are and what they do, give monetary donations, volunteer their time, and to reach hospice patients in the area. The website will make it easier for people to engage with The Bloom Project. I have determined these goals through my research of the website, my interviews, and through my overarching and specific goals exercises.</p>
				<p>My specific goals are a result of what The Bloom Project’s website is lacking as well as what I learned is important for an audience through my interviews. Yes, they do have donors, sponsors, and volunteers, but the website is difficult to navigate, and things get overlooked because of its clutter of information. According to my interviews it is very important for websites to have clear organization so, organization will be key in redesigning their site.</p>
