						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p class="info">After collecting all of the research and determining my audience and goals, I determined my call-to-action. In my case, I have two call-to-actions since I have two main audiences, the volunteers and the donors.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/web-sketch.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>I decided to make my first call-to-action "Volunteer", this is so that when they click on the button there will be several different opportunities and descriptions showing what is required of them if they were to volunteer. Users usually know that the next page will give them more details about what they are getting themselves into. Through my interviews, I became more aware that knowing when events will take place, or knowing specific dates when The Bloom Project will need volunteers is very important for a user. It sometimes makes a user anxious to sign up when they don't exactly know what they are getting themselves into.</p>
							<p>My secondary call-to-action is simply, "Donate". The Bloom Project is already an established non-profit, so they have several sponsors and people who donate monthly making this CTA not as important as my first. Although they already have lots of donors, there are always people such as florists, newlyweds, and churches that have left over flowers that they can put to good use by donating them to an organization like this.</p>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u1"><p>I then created a style tile that features all of my design elements such as type, CTA buttons, color, and textures that communicate the goals of the organization.</p></div>
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/style-tile-revised.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>My style tile for The Bloom Project communicates their organization as being inviting, personal, thoughtful, friendly and peaceful. I chose these adjectives because this is what I think is important for hospice patients to know and feel. They need inviting and personal people who are going to show them the love and peace they deserve. I chose Mort Modern Medium for my header, Univers 55 Roman for my subhead, and Univers 45 Light for my text links. I feel as though these typeface combinations create the stability The Bloom Project needs for their website, but is also friendly for visitors of the site.</p>
							<p>The red-orange color is used to catch the attention of the viewer, but then I added a yellow ochre color and a pale green to bring some friendliness and life into the pages. The photos I chose to represent on my style tile are the types of imagery I would use on the website that gives a personal and strong feeling. Like the banner on my style tile says, I want users to feel the power that flowers can bring.	</p><p>
